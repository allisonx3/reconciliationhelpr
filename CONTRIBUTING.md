# Contributing to ReconciliationHelpr

Hey there! If you somehow found this tool helpful and want to make it even better - that's awesome! 

This started as a "I'd rather spend 5 hours semi-automating a 1-hour task" kind of project, so if you have ideas for improvements, I'm all ears.


## Ways to Help

### Found a Bug?

If something's not working right, let me know by opening an issue! Try to include:

* What you were trying to do
* What actually happened
* Steps to reproduce it (if you can figure them out)
* Screenshots if you've got them
* Your bank's CSV format if it's relevant ((but please no real transaction data! Just the column names (i.e. date, withdrawal, etc) should be good.))

### Have an Idea for an Improvement?

Got an idea that would make this more useful? Open an issue & tell me about it! For example:
* Better handling of split transactions (I am aware it is not good)
* Support for other bank formats
* A better way to match transactions
* Anything else you think would be helpful!

### Want to Contribute Code?

Amazing! Here's how:

1. Fork the repo
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start development server with `npm start`
5. Create a branch for your feature
6. Test your changes
7. Commit with clear commit messages
8. Push to your fork
9. Submit a Pull Request
10. Test that it still works
11. Submit a pull request

Some loose guidelines:
* Add comments explaining what your code does (I am not a developer by day, or night either really)
* Try to keep things simple & understandable
* Test your changes to make sure they work
* If you add new features, update the README or any other documentation as needed
