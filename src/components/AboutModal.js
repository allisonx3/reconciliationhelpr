          <h3>Why Use This?</h3>
          <p>
            Don't have the attention span to remember to reconcile every day/week?<br />
            Tired of squinting at spreadsheets or bank UIs trying to find that one missing transaction?
          </p>

          <p>Same!</p>
         
          <p>
            Born from the classic developer mindset of "I'd rather spend 5 hours 
            automating a 1-hour task than do it manually" - ReconciliationHelpr 
            exists because I was frustrated trying to figure out why my YNAB balance 
            didn't match my bank account.
          </p>

          <p>
            So I built this tool to help me reconcile my bank statements with YNAB for when I forget to reconcile often enough.

          <h3>What It Does</h3>
          <p>
            This app helps you identify discrepancies between your bank statement and YNAB 
            by comparing transactions side by side. It's not magic - it won't automatically 
            fix your reconciliation issues, but it will make it much easier to spot where 
            things don't match up.

            <h4>Split Transactions</h4>
            <p>
              YNAB's export shows split transactions as separate entries, so these will 
              always appear as "unmatched" compared to your bank statement. Look for 
              transactions on the same date to identify splits.
            </p>

            <h4>Date Mismatches</h4>
            <p>
              If you manually enter transactions or schedule them in advance, YNAB's dates 
              might not match your bank statement. Pro tip: First use this tool to identify 
              date mismatches, update them in YNAB, then re-run the comparison for a more 
              accurate reconciliation.
